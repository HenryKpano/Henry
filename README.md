#### 👋 Hi there, I'm Henry, a Cloud Data Engineer with a passion for building and managing scalable, reliable infrastructure also building data pipelines and enhancing analytics.

Leveraging my extensive experience as a Cloud Data Engineer, I am proficient in managing and optimizing AWS cloud services such as Amazon S3, RDS, VPC, EC2, IAM, Lambda, and Amazon EventBridge. My expertise extends to implementing monitoring solutions with AWS CloudWatch and enhancing security through robust IAM and VPC policies, ensuring strict adherence to the principle of least privilege.


I possess strong skills in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using HashiCorp Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. My ability to modularize Terraform configurations streamlines AWS resource creation, reduces pipeline maintenance time, and facilitates the adoption of new infrastructure. By applying the landing zone accelerator approach, I enable efficient cloud migrations and infrastructure deployment, making systems production-ready with minimal downtime. This approach also supports scalable infrastructure management while reducing manual configurations.


As a seasoned Data Engineer, I specialize in designing and maintaining scalable DBT data models, optimizing ELT pipelines using medallion architecture, and architecting AWS Lambda integrations with DynamoDB for efficient data management. My work consistently drives performance improvements, such as reducing query latency and enhancing data processing efficiency.


In addition to my technical proficiency, I am adept at Agile methodologies, employing tools like Jira for effective task and project management. I utilize Confluence to document processes and procedures meticulously, ensuring clarity and alignment across team members regarding project goals, workflows, and deadlines.


For architectural visualization, I rely on tools like draw.io to create comprehensive AWS architecture diagrams. These visual representations enhance communication of infrastructure designs and dependencies among stakeholders, improving project transparency and team efficiency. This practice ensures timely, budget-conscious, and high-quality project delivery.


Currently, at Nkomor Healthcare Inc., I apply my expertise in AWS cloud technologies, Data Engineering, and advanced analytics to deliver high-quality data solutions. I focus on optimizing data transformation for BI, reducing query latency, and enhancing workflow efficiencies through modularized Terraform, IAM policies, and performance-optimized SQL queries.


I am passionate about technology and the role it plays in enabling businesses to achieve their goals. I am excited to continue to grow my career in the field of DevOps and look forward to contributing to the success of future projects and teams.
